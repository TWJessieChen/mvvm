# MVVM Example

This is Koin MVVM Example code.

## Getting Started and Use

## What is Data Binding Library? - https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding

The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

## What is LiveData ? - https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata

LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
